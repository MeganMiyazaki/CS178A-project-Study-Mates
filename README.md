# CS178A Project
## Proposal
Study Mates

Description: Study Mates will be a mobile application with the primary function of helping the user focus on studying using the pomodoro method. A study mate, a pokemon-inspired concept, will be the main motivation to make the user study. The application will keep track of how long the user studies for in total and reward them for longer hours of study through in-game currency to upgrade/decorate their study mate. The user can interact with their study mate and be able to play and take care of them like a virtual pet. 

Teammates: Gabriela Alvarez, Cindy Do, Megan Miyazaki, Ashley Pham

Tools That Will Be Used: Swift

Schedule for Daily Meetings: 10pm

Final Vision: The final app will allow the user to adopt/take care of an ingame virtual pet that encourages the user to study. The user will be required to study for a certain amount of time before being able to earn coins and/or interacting with their pet. Coins can be used to buy cosmetic items or treats for their pet to improve their friendship.

Vision for the End of This Quarter:  By the end of the quarter, we expect to figure out the basics of app development and start with a barebones app that includes the timer to count studying hours and adding in a few virtual pets.
